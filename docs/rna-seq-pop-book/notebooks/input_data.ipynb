    "2. The user can add \"fq1\" and \"fq2\" columns to the `samples.tsv` metadata file, containing the path to each fastq file from the root rna-seq-pop directory. This means the fastq files can be stored anywhere accessible and have arbitrary naming. In the config.yaml, this option is  `fastq['auto'] == False`.\n",

The user must provide a fasta file containing the transcriptome sequence in fasta format. For variant calling, genome alignment is performed with hisat2, which requires a fasta file containing the genome sequence. All input `.fa` files can be gzipped `.fa.gz`. \n",
