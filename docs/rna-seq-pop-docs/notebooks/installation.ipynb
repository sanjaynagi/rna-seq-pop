    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA-Seq-Pop does not require installation, however, users must have [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/) and [conda](https://conda.io/) installed in order to run the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conda**\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is an open-source package management system, which allows users to install a variety of packages and programs whilst managing software environments and dependencies. In general, we recommend using the miniconda installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html \n",
    "\n",
    "**Snakemake**\n",
    "\n",
    "Snakemake is a workflow management system to create reproducible and scalable computational analyses. RNA-Seq-Pop is written in snakemake, which itself is python-based. The Snakemake authors encourage installation through conda. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also need [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which you can install with `pip install pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### *RNA-Seq-Pop*\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to clone the RNA-Seq-Pop github repository to your system. You may use the below command, replacing `my_repo_name` with something of your choice. This may be useful in case you ever use RNA-Seq-Pop on multiple datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone --recursive https://github.com/sanjaynagi/rna-seq-pop.git my_repo_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you think you may want to contribute to RNA-Seq-Pop, you may wish to fork the repository to your github account prior to cloning. For more information, please the [docs on contributing](https://sanjaynagi.github.io/rna-seq-pop/notebooks/contributing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the workflow contains a submodule (compkaryo), we should use `git clone --recursive` to clone the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run RNA-Seq-Pop, it is important to use the `--use-conda` directive - this will automatically install all necessary packages into isolated software environments, so we do not have to install any other dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also ensure your conda has channel priorities set to 'flexible', otherwise, conda may throw up errors when installing packages. You can do this with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda config --set channel_priority flexible\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing the setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether RNA-Seq-Pop is configured correctly, from the root directory you can perform a dry-run on the test dataset, with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "snakemake --cores 1 --directory .test/ --use-conda -n\n",
    "```"
