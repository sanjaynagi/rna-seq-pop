    "# Contributing to the workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "We massively encourage contributions to the workflow. We hope that with the feedback and contributions of the scientific community, we can improve RNA-Seq-Pop further, making it more comprehensive, robust, accessible and easy-to-use. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any feedback on how the workflow may be improved, please do get in touch by emailing or raising an [issue on github](https://github.com/sanjaynagi/rna-seq-pop/issues), or fork the github repository and create a pull request for any additional features you would like to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have any ideas but feel like contributing to the workflow, I will continue to raise future features or bugs in the [issues](https://github.com/sanjaynagi/rna-seq-pop/issues) page of the github repository, please leave a comment if you would like to work on any. \n",

    "#### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First fork to your own account, and then clone that repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone --recursive git@github.com:yourusername/rna-seq-pop.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make any changes to the workflow, commit and push them back to your local fork, and create a pull request. In case you are unfamiliar with this process, step-by-step tutorials on contributing to software can be found [online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_FLqX3vGR4). "
