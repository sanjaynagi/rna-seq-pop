dataset: 'Ag_Bouake'                            # Dataset name: Can be anything, will be used to name some main output files

## Fastq filenames and locations can either be specified in the config/fastq.tsv file. 
## OR if auto: True -
## gzipped fastq files should be stored in the resources/reads/ directory
## If the sample name is Kisumu1 in the samples.tsv file, the paired-end reads 
## should be named Kisumu1_1.fastq.gz, and Kisumu1_2.fastq.gz. 
## Treatment names in samples.tsv should not contain underscores

# Chromosome names for the appropriate species.
# Currently, the variant calling and analysis part of workflow requires genes mapped to chromosomes and their physical location.
# Please ensure that these correspond exactly to the reference fasta/gff files. Extra unwanted chromosomes (unplaced contigs) can be ignored. 
# if you need to remove a prefix (Such as "AgamP4_"or "AaegL5_") from a file, use this sed command - i.e - "sed s/AgamP4_// An.gambiae.fasta > An.gambiae_clean.fasta"
